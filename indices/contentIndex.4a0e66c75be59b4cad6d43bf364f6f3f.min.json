Over time, the consensus has been that the federal government should hold the most power, and that federal trumps state.\n\n- *Marbury v. Madison (1803)*: Established Judicial Review\n\t- William Marbury was appointed as a judge by John Adams (Federalist)\n\t- Thomas Jefferson, was the incoming president (Republican)\n\t- James Madison, the secretary of state under Jefferson, refused to process the appointment\n\t- The court found he case to be unconstitutional\n- *Judicial Review*: Courts can determine if laws or executive actions are unconstitutional\n- *McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)*: Better established the separation between state and federal government; federal government set up a federal bank, state could not tax federal government\n- *Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)*: Established that Congress has the power to regulate inter-state commerce\n- States Rights: The idea that states have rights that cannot be  interfered with by the federal government \n\t- Southern states used states rights argue their right to secede over slavery\n\t- With the south's loss in the Civil War, the answer to \"can a state secede?\" was determined to be \"no.\"\n- Dual Federalism: A model of government in which the state and national government are essentially equal is power; that the state is reserved some powers, and the national others\n\t- This style of government was generally followed by the US until the 1930s\n\t- ex: In 1916, the Supreme Court declared that a federal law that barred products created from child labor from interstate commerce\n- Cooperative Federalism: A model of government in which all branches of government cooperate; where national and state governments complement each other\n\t- This change is style was caused by the Great Depression\n\t- ex: The New Deal\n\t\t- Involved government regulation, spending, public assistance programs, etc.\n\t- Before the 1930s, the Supreme Court was much more restrictive of the federal government\n- Picket-Fence Federalism: A model of government in which every level of government is involved in policy\n\t- The policy is the fence, the boards on the fence are the levels of government\n- The Commerce Clause: The federal government has the right to regulate commerce\n\t- ex: In 1942, the Supreme Court held that wheat production by an individual farmer created only for personal use was subject to regulation\n- Federal Preemption: State laws that conflict with federal laws are invalidated\n\n---\n\nSOURCE :: [[media/10PEG - Unit 2 - Textbook Section 3.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-10T22:45:52.09384329Z","tags":null},"/C-lambda-nu":{"title":"","content":"[[Equation]] for the [[Speed]] of [[Light]]\n\n$$\n\\large{C = \\lambda \\nu}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\t- $C$ is the speed of light\n\t- $\\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength]] of light\n\t- $\\nu$ ([[nu]]) is the frequency","lastmodified":"2022-10-10T22:45:52.09384329Z","tags":null},"/Chemical-Properties":{"title":"","content":"[[Trait]]s that are judged by how something behaves in the presence of another [[Substance]]\n\n- ex:\n\t- [[Iron]] [[Oxidation|rusts]] in [[Oxygen]]\n\t- [[Noble Gas]] are not very [[Reactivity|Reactive]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-10T22:45:52.09384329Z","tags":null},"/Cordia-Hub":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-10T22:45:52.09384329Z","tags":null},"/Element":{"title":"","content":"Basic building block of matter (excluding the [[Elementary Particles]]), cannot be broken down\n\n- ex: [[Hydrogen]], [[Oxygen]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-10T22:45:52.09384329Z","tags":null},"/Evidence-of-Electromagnetic-Radiation-Particle-Transmission":{"title":"","content":"- [[Max Planck]] (in 1900) discovered that when you heat a solid to a high [[Temperature]], the [[Solid]] emits a particular [[Energy]] (ex: [[Color]])\n\t- ex: $\\text{Fe}$ when heated $\\rightarrow$ red $\\rightarrow$ orange $\\rightarrow$ white $\\rightarrow$ blue\n\t- $E = h\\nu$ ($\\nu$ = [[nu]], means [[Frequency]])\n\t- Related: [[Fluorescence]], [[Phosphorescence]]\n- [[Albert Einstein]] (in 1921) discovered the [[Photoelectric Effect]]\n\t- ![[media/AC00CD7A-E4F8-4245-BF50-DE8C96BE2469.jpeg|512]]\n\t- When [[Light]] of a certain [[Frequency]] in shined on a [[Metal]] plate, [[Electron]]s are emitted and complete the circuit\n\t- Introduced the concept of the [[Photon]], the [[Particle]] of [[Light]], carrying a [[Quanta]] of [[Energy]]\n- [[de Broglie]] (in 1924) discovered that [[Light]] can behave as both a [[Wave]] and a [[Particle]] ([[Wave Particle Duality]])\n\t- $$\\Large{\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}}$$\n\t\t- $\\lambda$ = [[Lambda]]\n\t\t- $h$ = [[Constant]]\n\t\t- $m$ = [[Mass]]\n\t\t- $v$ = [[Velocity]]\n\t\t- ex: Car moving at 25 [[Meter]]/[[Second]]\n\t\t\t- $\\large{\\frac{6.626 * 10^{-34} * J* S}{910 \\text{kg} * 25 \\text{m}{s}} = 2.9 * 10^{-38}\\text{m}}$\n- [[Niels Bohr]]: [[Quantized Atom]] (in 1913) for [[Hydrogen]]\n\t1.
