I found that multiple of my ideas were too difficult to implement, and as such I discarded said ideas.\n\n![[media/10JaM - Aluminum Project - Display Photo.jpeg]]\n\n## Wire Project\n\nI started this project late as I still finishing my aluminum project. Even so, I think these came out good.\n\nMy first idea. 2 22 gauge copper wires were threaded through each \n\n![[media/10JaM - Wire Project - Latch Bracelet 1.jpg]]\n![[media/10JaM - Wire Project - Latch Bracelet 2.jpg]]\n\nA simple ring. Made from 3 22 gauge wires twisted using a drill. The ends were soldered together at the end.\n\n![[media/10JaM - Wire Project - Coil Ring.jpg]]\n\nA keychain made from the leftover wire from the ring. The decoration at the bottom was from the scrap bin. The decoration was threaded onto one of the wires, which was then tied. The top was soldered to itself, then attached to a key ring.\n\n![[media/10JaM - Wire Project - Keychain.jpg]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/10JaM-Wire-and-Soldering-Notes":{"title":"","content":"## Tool labelling\n\n| Tool          | Image                                                           |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Round-Nose    | ![[media/A4835AF3-AF22-4A37-B634-7BA41AD4C6B8.jpeg\\|256]] |\n| Chain-Nose    | ![[media/8A12B3F0-FD67-4F76-A738-0DCEFAA6294F.jpeg\\|256]] |\n| Flat-Nose     | ![[media/6D87B887-5D2F-43DB-877C-F225E3937608.jpeg\\|256]] |\n| Flush Cutters | ![[media/1CFFD81D-36B7-474E-BC34-C4FDE0538B2C.jpeg\\|256]] |\n\n## Hammer vs Mallet\n\n- A mallet is made of one head, usually of wood or rubber\n- They are used to hit softer\n- A hammer is made generally of metal\n- They are used to hit things like nails\n\n## Flux\n\n![[media/10JaM - Flux.jpeg]]\n\n- Flux: “a compound, often made with borax,  which is applied onto a joint before soldering to prevent oxides.

Over time, the consensus has been that the federal government should hold the most power, and that federal trumps state.\n\u003e \n\n- *Marbury v. Madison (1803)*: Established Judicial Review\n\t- William Marbury was appointed as a judge by John Adams (Federalist)\n\t- Thomas Jefferson, was the incoming president (Republican)\n\t- James Madison, the secretary of state under Jefferson, refused to process the appointment\n\t- The court found he case to be unconstitutional\n- *Judicial Review*: Courts can determine if laws or executive actions are unconstitutional\n- *McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)*: Better established the separation between state and federal government; federal government set up a federal bank, state could not tax federal government\n- *Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)*: Established that Congress has the power to regulate inter-state commerce\n- States Rights: The idea that states have rights that cannot be  interfered with by the federal government \n\t- Southern states used states rights argue their right to secede over slavery\n\t- With the south's loss in the Civil War, the answer to \"can a state secede?\" was determined to be \"no.\"\n- Dual Federalism: A model of government in which the state and national government are essentially equal is power; that the state is reserved some powers, and the national others\n\t- This style of government was generally followed by the US until the 1930s\n\t- ex: In 1916, the Supreme Court declared that a federal law that barred products created from child labor from interstate commerce\n- Cooperative Federalism: A model of government in which all branches of government cooperate; where national and state governments complement each other\n\t- This change is style was caused by the Great Depression\n\t- ex: The New Deal\n\t\t- Involved government regulation, spending, public assistance programs, etc.\n\t- Before the 1930s, the Supreme Court was much more restrictive of the federal government\n- Picket-Fence Federalism: A model of government in which every level of government is involved in policy\n\t- The policy is the fence, the boards on the fence are the levels of government\n- The Commerce Clause: The federal government has the right to regulate commerce\n\t- ex: In 1942, the Supreme Court held that wheat production by an individual farmer created only for personal use was subject to regulation\n- Federal Preemption: State laws that conflict with federal laws are invalidated\n\n---\n\n- SOURCE :: [[media/10PEG - Unit 2 - Textbook Section 3.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/C-lambda-nu":{"title":"","content":"[[Equation]] for the [[Speed of Light]]\n\n$$\n\\large{C = \\lambda \\nu}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\t- $C$ is the speed of light\n\t- $\\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength]] of light\n\t- $\\nu$ ([[nu]]) is the frequency","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/Chemical-Properties":{"title":"","content":"[[Trait]]s that are judged by how something behaves in the presence of another [[Substance]]\n\n- ex:\n\t- [[Iron]] [[Oxidation|Rusts]] in [[Oxygen]]\n\t- [[Noble Gas]] are not very [[Reactivity|Reactive]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/Cordia-Hub":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/Element":{"title":"","content":"Basic building block of matter (excluding the [[Elementary Particles]]), cannot be broken down\n\n- ex: [[Hydrogen]], [[Oxygen]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T17:46:54.222714032Z","tags":null},"/Evidence-of-Electromagnetic-Radiation-Particle-Transmission":{"title":"","content":"- [[Max Planck]] (in 1900) discovered that when you heat a solid to a high [[Temperature]], the [[Solid]] emits a particular [[Energy]] (ex: [[Color]])\n\t- ex: $\\text{Fe}$ when heated $\\rightarrow$ red $\\rightarrow$ orange $\\rightarrow$ white $\\rightarrow$ blue\n\t- $E = h\\nu$ ($\\nu$ = [[nu]], means [[Frequency]])\n\t- Related: [[Fluorescence]], [[Phosphorescence]]\n- [[Albert Einstein]] (in 1921) discovered the [[Photoelectric Effect]]\n\t- ![[media/The Photoelectric Effect.jpeg|512]]\n\t- When [[Light]] of a certain [[Frequency]] in shined on a [[Metal]] plate, [[Electron]]s are emitted and complete the circuit\n\t- Introduced the concept of the [[Photon]], the [[Particle]] of [[Light]], carrying a [[Quanta]] of [[Energy]]\n- [[de Broglie]] (in 1924) discovered that [[Light]] can behave as both a [[Wave]] and a [[Particle]] ([[Wave Particle Duality]])\n\t- $$\\Large{\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}}$$\n\t\t- $\\lambda$ = [[Lambda]]\n\t\t- $h$ = [[Constant]]\n\t\t- $m$ = [[Mass]]\n\t\t- $v$ = [[Velocity]]\n\t\t- ex: Car moving at 25 [[Meter]]/[[Second]]\n\t\t\t- $\\large{\\frac{6.626 * 10^{-34} * J* S}{910 \\text{kg} * 25 \\text{m}{s}} = 2.9 * 10^{-38}\\text{m}}$\n- [[Niels Bohr]]: [[Quantized Atom]] (in 1913) for [[Hydrogen]]\n\t1.
