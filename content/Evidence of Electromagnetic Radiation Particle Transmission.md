- [[Max Planck]] (in 1900) discovered that when you heat a solid to a high [[Temperature]], the [[Solid]] emits a particular [[Energy]] (ex: [[Color]])
	- ex: $\text{Fe}$ when heated $\rightarrow$ red $\rightarrow$ orange $\rightarrow$ white $\rightarrow$ blue
	- $E = h\nu$ ($\nu$ = [[nu]], means [[Frequency]])
	- Related: [[Fluorescence]], [[Phosphorescence]]
- [[Albert Einstein]] (in 1921) discovered the [[Photoelectric Effect]]
	- ![[media/AC00CD7A-E4F8-4245-BF50-DE8C96BE2469.jpeg|512]]
	- When [[Light]] of a certain [[Frequency]] in shined on a [[Metal]] plate, [[Electron]]s are emitted and complete the circuit
	- Introduced the concept of the [[Photon]], the [[Particle]] of [[Light]], carrying a [[Quanta]] of [[Energy]]
- [[de Broglie]] (in 1924) discovered that [[Light]] can behave as both a [[Wave]] and a [[Particle]] ([[Wave Particle Duality]])
	- $$\Large{\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}}$$
		- $\lambda$ = [[Lambda]]
		- $h$ = [[Constant]]
		- $m$ = [[Mass]]
		- $v$ = [[Velocity]]
		- ex: Car moving at 25 [[Meter]]/[[Second]]
			- $\large{\frac{6.626 * 10^{-34} * J* S}{910 \text{kg} * 25 \text{m}{s}} = 2.9 * 10^{-38}\text{m}}$
- [[Niels Bohr]]: [[Quantized Atom]] (in 1913) for [[Hydrogen]]
	1. [[Hydrogen]] has only certain allowable [[Energy Level]]s
	2. Lowest [[Energy State]] is [[Ground State]]
	3. When the [[Electron]] receives the right amount of [[Quanta]] of [[Energy]], it may move to an [[Excited State]]
	4. When [[Electron]] return from [[Excited State|Excited]] to [[Ground State|Ground]], they emit [[Photon]]s of specific [[Energy]] $\rightarrow$ [[Bright Line Emission Spectra]]
- [[Schrodinger]]â€™s [[Quantum Mechanical Model]]
	- [[Electron]]s are located in high [[Probabiilty]] areas called [[Orbitals]] whose [[Probabiilty]] is described by [[Wave Function Equations]]
