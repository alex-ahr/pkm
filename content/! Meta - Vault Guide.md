> [!CAUTION] TODO
> TODO :: Entire file. Good idea to get the bare minimum, then expand.

A guide to this vault and how this PKM system is managed.

## Principles

- simplicity
- ease-of-use
- scalable

## Structure

{
All files are kept on the root of the vault, except for files that are best kept in their own directory
}

## Tags

TODO :: Description for ## Tags

### `TYPE/`

The `TYPE/` tag is for denoting what the file is structured like. The structure is fairly loose.

Some of the most important types:

- `TYPE/atom`: a self-contained file that defines something. It generally links to other files.

Atoms are structured as follows:

```

{definition & explanation}

{optional helping diagram/equation/graphic}

{optional additional explanation}

{- Related files}
```

ex: [[Pascal's Triangle]]

![[Pascal's Triangle]]

## Naming Convention

Files that strictly fall under a certain subject are prepended by the subject's name.

ex: [[Cordia - The City of Cordia]]

Files are only named like this if they cannot be separated from their subject - in the above example, a fictional city in a certain world can only be relevant to that world.

Naming like this is great for school subjects.

ex: [[school/10HC - Hub]]
