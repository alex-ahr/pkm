| Tag    | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atom` | Self-contained file, links to other files (ex: [[Element]])                                                                                                                     |

| `note` | File whose content is created from a source, generally unstructured. Often used as a source for new atoms (ex: [[Evidence of Electromagnetic Radiation Particle Transmission]]) |
| `idk`  | File that I don’t know how to type                                                                                                                                                                                |

## `STATUS/`

| Tag          | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `good`       | Good quality, generally the standard                          |
| `great`      | Great quality, standout (like featured articles on Wikipedia) |
| `ok`         | Ok quality, written but could use a revisit                   |
| `bad`        | Bad quality, in need of more work                             |
| `inprogress` | If a file can be completed and is not completed yet           |
| `done`       | If a file can be completed and is complete                    |
| `todo`       | Needs to be done                                              |

- Notes:
	- `STATUS/{good,great,ok,bad}` vs `STATUS/{done,inprogress}`:
		- The former is for the quality of a work, while the latter is only for files that can be “completed”, like a unit in a class, a project, or a writing
