> In the beginning of the United States, the separation of powers between the state and federal government was in contention. Over time, the consensus has been that the federal government should hold the most power, and that federal trumps state.

- *Marbury v. Madison (1803)*: Established Judicial Review
	- William Marbury was appointed as a judge by John Adams (Federalist)
	- Thomas Jefferson, was the incoming president (Republican)
	- James Madison, the secretary of state under Jefferson, refused to process the appointment
	- The court found he case to be unconstitutional
- *Judicial Review*: Courts can determine if laws or executive actions are unconstitutional
- *McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)*: Better established the separation between state and federal government; federal government set up a federal bank, state could not tax federal government
- *Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)*: Established that Congress has the power to regulate inter-state commerce
- States Rights: The idea that states have rights that cannot be  interfered with by the federal government 
	- Southern states used states rights argue their right to secede over slavery
	- With the south's loss in the Civil War, the answer to "can a state secede?" was determined to be "no."
- Dual Federalism: A model of government in which the state and national government are essentially equal is power; that the state is reserved some powers, and the national others
	- This style of government was generally followed by the US until the 1930s
	- ex: In 1916, the Supreme Court declared that a federal law that barred products created from child labor from interstate commerce
- Cooperative Federalism: A model of government in which all branches of government cooperate; where national and state governments complement each other
	- This change is style was caused by the Great Depression
	- ex: The New Deal
		- Involved government regulation, spending, public assistance programs, etc.
	- Before the 1930s, the Supreme Court was much more restrictive of the federal government
- Picket-Fence Federalism: A model of government in which every level of government is involved in policy
	- The policy is the fence, the boards on the fence are the levels of government
- The Commerce Clause: The federal government has the right to regulate commerce
	- ex: In 1942, the Supreme Court held that wheat production by an individual farmer created only for personal use was subject to regulation
- Federal Preemption: State laws that conflict with federal laws are invalidated
